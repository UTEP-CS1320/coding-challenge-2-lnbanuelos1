### CODING CHALLENGE #2: REPORT

  This challenge was a one that put me to think. I made two versions of it, the first one not working fully, but I think the second one, the second one being the one that I am turning in, is the one that works the best. I used in total 6 if statements. At first I put in every parameter for detecting the ranges as well as the line that detected the error message if the distolic pressure was higher than the sytyolic pressure, but I found that by inputting higher dbp the output was "Normal" as well as "Error". This made me re-work the entire code.
  In the second iteration of the code I started by introducing the first if statement that states if dp is higher than sp then print error,if that statement is false, then the program can continue to the following steps. For the following steps I used else if statements that set parameters for both sp and dp, with these steps the computer computes the 
category of the blood pressure that is being input. For range detection I used and logic gates. That is how I completed this coding challenge.
